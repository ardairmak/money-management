# Money Management App

We developed this app to track incomes/expenses/future payments using React Native and Firebase for the Software Engineering Course project.

## Purpose

We have designed our system with a primary focus on effectively empowering users to 
manage their finances by offering a user-friendly platform.

Unlike common apps, we provide a comprehensive solution for budget management, 
placing a strong emphasis on managing future expenses (such as bills, installments, and planned expenses) alongside tracking incomes and expenses. We aim to simplify financial tracking across multiple accounts, offering clear insights into spending patterns and helping users make informed decisions about their money. Moreover, our calendar feature provides a holistic view of users' financials, displaying income, expenses, events, and upcoming expenses in one unified platform.  

Ultimately, our goal is to promote financial awareness and stability with ease of use for 
individuals at all levels of financial literacy, regardless of banking affiliations.
